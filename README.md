#Styling is the last step of the application#

First implementation !
first comes the intake of money or deposits into you account in the form of income from various sources, ammounting to one full bank balance.
By creating a separate index template, I can use input fields to add income, incoming from varous streams, while stating each of the source's names in a text box alont side the int income stream box.
I should aim to somehow create a add row link button to add an empty row containing input fields to enter you extra income sources.
