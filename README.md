 CS50-Final-Project
Monthly finances tracking application, designed to effectively aid you into timely paying your credit card bills.
what should the features be for the application.
let us analyze the finances for a month and all the things that we have to do to effectively manage our finances.

Styling is the last step of the application

First implementation !
first comes the intake of money or deposits into you account in the form of income from various sources, ammounting to one full bank balance.
By creating a separate index template, I can use input fields to add income, incoming from varous streams, while stating each of the source's names in a text box alont side the int income stream box.
I should aim to somehow create a add row link button to add an empty row containing input fields to enter you extra income sources.
Second implementation is to add up all of these imcomes in to one net pay, with an add button.
Third I need the addition of sources name alongside their amounts, like all these sources amount up to this much total, together with their individual contributions.


We need a clear the previous buffer as well for new financial analysis !
